# BiasLens
BiasCheck is a browser extension designed to detect political bias in news
articles in real time. It helps users identify subtle or overt biases, promotes
media literacy, and encourages balanced news consumption by recommending
alternative perspectivesâ€”all without disrupting the browsing experience. Unlike
existing tools that analyze entire websites or require users to visit external
platforms, BiasCheck focuses on individual articles and integrates seamlessly
into the user's workflow.

## Building from source

1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ewandeyb/bias_lens/
cd bias_lens
```
2. Obtain a [GNews](https://gnews.io/) API Key.
3. Obtain a [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) or any other LLM API Key.
4. Create your personal backend repository for storing the API Keys.
  - This backend repo will also be handling the calls to your LLM Agent.
  - See the following link [*Agents in Mistral*](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/agents/)
5. Set the parameters for your LLM agent to the following:
  - Summarize: [news text]"
  - Output: "Short summary."
  - Context: news summarization, small free model
6. Install `npm` dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```
7. Build the extension bundle. This should create a `/dist` directory, which
   will contain your local extension.
```bash
npm run build
```
8. Go to your Chromium browser settings, and enable *Developer Mode*.
9. Load an unpacked extension.
10. Select the generated `./dist` directory.
11. You should now be able to get the extension working when you visit a
    supported news site.
